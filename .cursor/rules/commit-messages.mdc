Commit Messages:

1. Follow conventional commits format: `type(scope): description`
1. Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, etc.
1. Include a clear scope indicating the affected component
1. Write a concise description of the change
1. Add bullet points for detailed changes in the commit body, it's ok to use emojis
1. Limit all commit message lines to 100 characters maximum
